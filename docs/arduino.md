* Left joystick y-axis controls speed and x-axis controls steering.
* Right joystick y-axis controls dump bed.
* "A" button turns lights on/off.
* "B" button executes "wiggle" function, moving motors and flashing lights.  If you have more than one vehicle, the button helps you

* Left bumper (L1 button) puts drive train in "low gear".  This makes it easier to attach a trailer or perform more precise movements.
